Follow these conventions for templates under `piwik_pro_mcp/assets/tag_manager/`.

## Organization
- Organize by resource type: `tags/`, `triggers/`, `variables/`
- Store well-formatted JSON with complete examples and field documentation

## Discovery Pattern
- Provide `get_available_*_templates()` and `get_*_template(name)` helpers
- Document editable vs read-only fields and include troubleshooting notes

## AI-Optimized Content
- Include usage examples, constraints, and best practices in template docs
